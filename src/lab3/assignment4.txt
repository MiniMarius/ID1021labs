//README this is a text explaining the differences in execution times of algorithms in assignment 3 and 4.

According to my measurements of execution time between the two algorithms, symbol table was the faster one.
Binary search tree has an average time complexity of O(log(n)) for search.
The symbol Table has an average time complexity of O(1) for search.
In the worst case, both BST and the symbol table has O(n) as time complexity.

The time complexity of the symbol table has O(1) with high probability depending on the amount
