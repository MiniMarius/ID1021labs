## how to run
It's recommended that you open up this repository directly from IntellIJ, since the lib dependency inside the repo is directly configured in this IDE. You can then choose whichever java class file to run and test. If you wish to use a CLI you'll have to configure the classpath/sourcepath yourself before compiling/running.
